  \section Introduction 

  \subsection Pre-Requisites

  This package requires of the following libraries and packages
	 - <A href="http://www.cmake.org">cmake</A>, a cross-platform build system.
	 - <A href="http://www.doxygen.org">doxygen</a> and 
	   <A href="http://www.graphviz.org">graphviz</a> to generate the documentation.
         - stdc++, 
	 .
  
  Under linux all of these utilities are available in ready-to-use packages.

  Under MacOS most of the packages are available via <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">fink</a>. <br>

  \subsection Compilation

  Just download this package, uncompress it, and execute
   - mkdir build
   - cd build
   - cmake ..
   .
  to generate the makefile and then
   - make
   .
  to obtain the shared library (in this case called <em>iriutils.so</em>) and
  also all the example programs.

  The <em>cmake</em> only need to be executed once (make will automatically call
  <em>cmake</em> if you modify one of the <em>CMakeList.txt</em> files).
  
  To execute the tests, do:
   - make test
   .
  To generate this documentation type
       - make doc
       .

  The files in the <em>build</em> directory are genetated by <em>cmake</em>
  and <em>make</em> and can be safely removed.
  After doing so you will need to call cmake manually again.

  \subsection Configuration

  The default build mode is DEBUG. That is, objects and executables 
  include debug information.

  The RELEASE build mode optimizes for speed. To build in this mode
  execute
      - cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
      .
  The release mode will be kept until next time cmake is executed.

  \subsection Installation

  In order to be able to use the library, it it necessary to copy it into the system.
  To do that, execute

      - make install
      .

  as root and the shared libraries will be copied to <em>/usr/local/lib/iriutils</em> directory
  and the header files will be copied to <em>/usr/local/include/iriutils</em> dierctory. At 
  this point, the library may be used by any user.

  To remove the library from the system, exceute
      - make uninstall
      .
  as root, and all the associated files will be removed from the system.

  \section Customization

  To build a new application using these library, first it is necessary to locate if the library
  has been installed or not using the following command

      - FIND_PACKAGE(project_name_here REQUIRED)

  In the case that the package is present, it is necessary to add the header files directory to
  the include directory path by using

      - INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${project_name_here_INCLUDE_DIR})

  Finally, it is also nevessary to link with the desired libraries by using the following command

      - TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(<executable name> ${project_name_here_LIBRARY})
      .
